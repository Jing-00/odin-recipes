        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><em>Bò Né is a delicious dish combining the best Vietnamese and French cuisine. It is a hearty 
            and satisfying breakfast dish that is also perfect for any time of day. The seared sizzling 
            steak and eggs are served with pate, tomatoes, onions, sunny-side-up fried egg, pickled vegetables,
            and a baguette for scooping.</em></p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb beef steak</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fish sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 large garlic cloves(peel and finely chop)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter(divided)</li>
            <li>Yellow onion(peel and cut into thin wedges)</li>
            <li>2 large tomatoes(cut into thick wedges)</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>4 small Banh Mi Vietnamese Baguette</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>You can keep the steak whole but I like to cut them into thick slices (about ⅛”) against the 
                grain for easy eating. In a medium bowl, mix together oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, dark 
                brown sugar, garlic, and sesame oil. Add sliced steak to the marinade and toss to coat. Marinate 
                for at least 15 minutes or overnight in the fridge, covered.</li>
            <li>Heat a single-serving cast-iron pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Add half tablespoon of 
                butter to the pan. Add the onions (¼ portion) to the pan and cook until they are softened and lightly 
                charred, about 5 minutes. Add marinated steak (¼ portion) to the pan and cook for about 5 minutes 
                total, or until it reaches your desired level of doneness if using whole steak.</li>
            <li>Once the steak is about done cooking, add half tablespoon of butter to the pan. Crack an egg into 
                the butter and cook to your desired doneness. I like mine sunny side up, with a runny yolk.</li>
            <li>Add a few slices of tomato wedges to the pan and cook until slightly charred.</li>
            <li>Garnish with cilantro or green onions. Add pickled vegetables and pate. Serve immediately with a 
                baguette. Repeat three more time as this recipe makes four servings.</li>
            <li>To enjoy, tear off a piece of baguette and dip it into the runny egg yolk. Use the baguette to scoop 
                up some of the steak, tomatoes, and pickled vegetables. Add a dollop of pate to your baguette. Take a 
                bite and enjoy the delicious combination of flavors!</li>
        </ol>
